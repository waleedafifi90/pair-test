    <h1>Class 04 - Pair programming</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <div>One team member should create a repository within GitHub called mc-exercise and add all other teammates as collaborators (in the ‘Settings’ tab, look for ‘Collaborators’ in the nav on the left of the screen.)

      Assign a member of your team to each character, and then do what they do. And do ONLY what they do.
      
      Our sample team has four members: Bob, Carol, Ted, and Alice. Add a file called FUBAR.md to the master branch of the repo. When we start, everyone is totally in sync and freshly pulled from master on their individual laptops, and has FUBAR.md. Bob and Carol are pair-programming one feature in FUBAR.md on Carol’s laptop in a new feature branch, and Ted and Alice are working on another feature in a different non-master feature branch on Ted’s laptop, also in FUBAR.md.</div>
